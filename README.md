# Flutter Light/Dark Neumorphism UI Demo

This Flutter app demonstrates a **Light/Dark Theme Toggle** feature using **Neumorphism Design** principles. The app uses soft shadows and modern Material3 design to create a subtle 3D effect on UI components. You can switch between light and dark themes dynamically, providing a smooth and visually appealing user experience.

## Features

- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Easily switch between light and dark themes for the app interface.
- **Neumorphism Design**: Implements 3D-like effects with soft, extruded shadows for a modern, minimalistic look.
- **Responsive UI**: Automatically adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless user experience across devices.
- **Immersive UI**: Status bar is hidden for a distraction-free, immersive interface.
